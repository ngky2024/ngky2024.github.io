### Illusory World of Mind

In present day world we all  have become slaves to our mind. Whatever we do, we do simply being swayed away  by our emotions, influenced by our thoughts and desires or being attracted by  allurements. But this should not be like this. We have to be master of our  mind. If we go according to the wrong ideas of our mind we will commit  mistakes. For example we may meet a person ugly in outlook and develop an  unwelcome attitude towards the person but the person may be very nice by  nature. This means we are deluded by the ideas of our mind and could not be  able to take a right decision. But all our activities are first done in mind  and then are expressed as speech and/or actions. And here our mind is cheating  us. Therefore we have to clean our mind so that we are not cheated.

A pampered child demands a  toy, then starts crying for it and after getting it soon he is dissatisfied and  either throws away or breaks the toy to cry for a second one, similarly for  third, fourth and so on. Our mind is like a pampered child, like the spoiled  son of a rich person who is addicted to alcohol or drugs, wastes money and does  not obey his parents and elders. First he did not control his son from the  beginning and now cry to the situation, still then is not able to leave  attachments. Similar is the situation of our mind. Can we do anything positive  with such a mind? We want to do something then after doing that we think this  was wrong. Again we want to do something and again commit the same mistake.  When shall we come out of the wrong impressions of the mind? If our mind  accepts something as noble even if that is not worthy to be noble, we accept it  as noble. Similarly if mind accepts something as horrible even if that is  honorable we accept it as horrible. Sometimes even if we understand proper, we  neglect it and do not work on it. We want to follow our ego blindly. This ego  is the spoiled child of our blind mind. This blind mind is king Dhŗtarāstra and  ego is its elder son Duryodhana, full of desires. We live in this kingdom of  lawlessness. This is the reason we create problems for ourselves, and dangers  for others.

### Right Understanding

In Śrimad Bhagavad-Gitā (3-42) Lord Kŗşna has said,

__indriyāņi parāņyāhurindriyebhyah param manah,__
__manasastu parā buddhiryo buddheh paratastu sah.__

Our organs, __indriyāņi__, viz. sense organs and action organs are said to be greater, __parāņyāhuh__ (than  our body), mind is greater than the organs, __indriyebhyah param manah__ intellect is greater than the mind, __manasastu parā buddhi__, and one who, __yah__ is greater than the intellect is He, __buddheh paratastu sah__, the Self.

In this saying lies the solution to  our problems. We have to bring our mind under the control of our intellect  means under the control of the discriminating intellect, and intellect under  the control of the Self. Then in our life it is only happiness. According to  the sayings of Lord Buddha, “From right understanding proceeds right thought;  from right thought proceeds right speech; from right speech proceeds right action  and from right action proceeds right livelihood”. So we have to make noble our  thinking, belief-system and thought processes means we have to make our  internal organ, mind, pure. According to Upanişads,

__śreyaśca preyaśca manuşyameta-stau samparītya vivinakti dhīrah,__
__śreyo hi dhīrobhi preyaso vŗņīte preyo mando  yogakshemadvŗņīte.__ (Ka. U.: 1-2-2)

The preferable (the exulted ones), __śreyah__, and pleasurable (the attached ones), __preyah__, both approach a man, __manuşyametah__. A man with discriminating intellect, __dhīrah__, separates, __vivinakti__, the two __tau__ and chooses __abhi vŗņīte__, the preferable in place of pleasurable, __śreyo hi preyaso__; but a man with  dull intellect, __mandah__, prefers the pleasurable for the growth and  protection, __preyo  yogakshemadvŗņīte__, of the body (for him body is the self).

### Prāņopāsanā develops Discriminating Intellect

But how a discriminating intellect  will develop, how mind will be cleaned? For this we need faith and devotion, we  should read scriptures, control the senses; and all these happens in mind only.  So we need some thing where mind is absorbed and that is our __prāņa__, the  vital force. It was said in Yogic scriptures, __‘indriyāņām mano nāthah  manonāthastu mārutah’__, mind is the master of sense organs and the air  (breath) is master of the mind. So we have to take the help of our breath.  Everyone experienced that when there is anger, greed, fear, sex, frustration,  desires, emotions etc are in our mind our breath also becomes different. That  is the reason to keep our mind in equanimity we have to make our breath stable.  This is our practice. Entire Vedic literature sings the glory of the knowledge  of __prāņa__, __prāņavidāya__. According to Prśnopanişad (6-4),

__“sa prāņamasŗjata prāņācchradhām kham vāyujyotirāpah pŗthivīndriyam manh,__
__annamannādvīryam tapo mantrāh karma lokā lokeşu ca nāma ca”,__

He has first created the __prāņa__, the Life Force. From __prāņa__ he created faith,  ether, air, fire, water, earth, organs, mind, food, vigour, austerities,   mantras, actions, worlds and name.

__Prāņa__ is the first part out of the sixteen parts of the God. Everything has been  created from __prāņa__ and merges in __prāņa__ and to know the __prāņa__ we have to take the support of our breath, __prāņavāyu__. We have to learn __prāņopāsnā__,  worship of prāņa; by that our internal subtle organs viz. mind etc will  be pure, concentration will increase, intellect will be sharp and  discrimination capability will develop. That is yoga, which is the practice  part of yoga. That has been known as kriyā-yoga. This is the technique to  balance the exhalation, __prāņa__, and inhalation, __apāna__; this is technique of suspension of breath, __prāņāyāma__. This is the technique of  merging the __prāņa__ and __apāna__, inhalation and exhalation in to __vyāna__,  the air that wholly pervades in the body. And for higher yogis it is the technique of winning over __udāna__, the air in body that has upward trend.  These all are called Kriyā-yoga. If we practice then there will be no tension in our life, we will not become living dead-bodies. We will always remain in life. This is the key to the happy life.
