Kriya-yoga is the ancient science of spiritual knowledge and practice found since the time immemorial but in the course of time the ancient knowledge of Kriya-yoga tended to be mutated and forgotten. In the year 1863 this was revitalized by an Himalayan Yogi known as Mahavatar Babaji Maharaj with transmition of the techniques to his beloved disciple Lahiri Mahasaya. 

The story of Lahidi Mahasaya’s meeting with Babaji is related in Paramahansa Yogananda’s book "Autobiography of a  Yogi". Lahidi Mahasaya obtained the supreme realization by the means of Kriya-yoga. He soon became
famous for this ancient meditation and many disciples were attracted to him.

One of his best disciples was Swami Shriyukteswar Giri, a great yogi and astrologer, who had many disciples, among whom outshines was Paramahamsa Yogananda, author of the book "Autobiography of a Yogi". Kriya Yoga
which is well known in India has spread then in the West since 1920, when Paramahansa Yogananda moved to the United States. 

One among Shriyukteswar's highly realized disciples was Swami Narayana Giri (Prabhujee) who was also his closest disciple remaining at his service till his last breath.


Swami Nityananda Giri (Rajahamsa) learned the Kriya-yoga techniques from Swami Shankarananda Giri who is a disciple of  Prabhujee.
